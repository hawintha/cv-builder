# CV Builder
> This project was developed as my solution to The Odin Project's [CV Application Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application)

CV Builder is a dynamic resume generator built with React JS. This project is designed to help users create CVs by inputting their information and seeing their changes being made live.

## Features
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Users can see their CV being created as data is inputted.
- **Example Data:** The resume has default information about Mickey Mouse for inspiration and to preview the layout.
